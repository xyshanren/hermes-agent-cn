# ---------- s6-overlay install ----------
# s6-overlay provides supervision for the main hermes process, the dashboard,
# and per-profile gateways. /init becomes PID 1 below — see ENTRYPOINT.
#
# Multi-arch: BuildKit auto-populates TARGETARCH (amd64 / arm64). s6-overlay
# uses tarball names keyed on the kernel arch string (x86_64 / aarch64), so
# we map between them inline. The noarch + symlinks tarballs are
# architecture-independent and reused as-is.
#
# We use `curl` instead of `ADD` for the per-arch tarball because `ADD`
# evaluates its URL at parse time, before any ARG / TARGETARCH substitution
# — splitting one URL per arch into two ADDs would download both on every
# build and leave dead bytes in the cache. A single curl + arch-keyed URL
# is simpler and cache-friendlier.
#
# Supply-chain integrity: every tarball is checksum-verified against the
# upstream-published SHA256. To bump S6_OVERLAY_VERSION, fetch the four
# `.sha256` files from the corresponding release and update the ARGs. The
# checksum lookup happens during build, so a compromised release artifact
# fails the build loudly instead of silently producing a tampered image.

# ---------- Layer-cached Python dependency install ----------

# download + native-extension compile layer is cached unless those inputs

# every source-only commit re-did ~4-5 min of dep work on cold builds.
#
# README.md is referenced by pyproject.toml's `readme =` field, but it's
# excluded from the build context by .dockerignore's `*.md`.  uv's build
# frontend stats the readme path during dep resolution, so we `touch` an
# empty placeholder — the real README is restored by `COPY . .` below.
#
# `uv sync --frozen --no-install-project --extra all --extra messaging`
# installs the deps reachable through the composite `[all]` extra
# (handpicked set intended for the production image), plus gateway
# messaging adapters that should work in the published image without a
# first-boot lazy install.  We do NOT use `--all-extras`:
# that would pull in `[rl]` (atroposlib + tinker + torch + wandb from
# git), `[yc-bench]` (another git dep), and `[termux-all]` (Android
# redundancy), none of which belong in the published container.
#
# Provider packages (anthropic, bedrock, azure-identity) are included
# so Docker users can use these providers without requiring runtime
# lazy-install access to PyPI (often blocked in containerized envs).
#
# The hindsight memory provider's client (hindsight-client) is baked in
# for the same reason: it lazy-installs into /opt/hermes/.venv at first
# use, which lives inside the (immutable) image layer rather than the
# mounted /opt/data volume, so it is lost on every container recreate /
# image update and recall/retain then fails with
# `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'hindsight_client'` (#38128).

# ---------- Permissions ----------
# Make install dir world-readable so any HERMES_UID can read it at runtime.

# node_modules trees additionally need to be writable by the hermes user
# so the runtime `npm install` triggered by _tui_need_npm_install() in
# hermes_cli/main.py succeeds (see #18800). /opt/hermes/web is build-time
# only (HERMES_WEB_DIST points at hermes_cli/web_dist) and is intentionally
# not chowned here.
# /opt/hermes/gateway is runtime-writable: Python may create __pycache__ and
# gateway state artifacts beneath the package after services drop privileges,
# especially when the hermes UID is remapped at boot (#27221).
# The .venv MUST remain hermes-writable so lazy_deps.py can install
# remaining optional platform packages and future pin bumps at first use.
# Without this, `uv pip install` fails with EACCES and adapters silently
# fail to load.  See tools/lazy_deps.py.

ENV HERMES_WEB_DIST=/opt/hermes/hermes_cli/web_dist

# fast path (`node --expose-gc /opt/hermes/ui-tui/dist/entry.js`) and skip the
# _tui_need_npm_install / runtime `npm install` branch entirely — exactly the
# nix/packaged-release path the launcher was designed for.
#
# Why this is required (not just an optimization): the root package-lock.json
# describes the WHOLE monorepo workspace set (root + web + ui-tui + apps/*),
# but the image only installs root/web/ui-tui (apps/* — the desktop app — is
# never `npm install`ed here). So the actualized node_modules permanently
# disagrees with the canonical lock, _tui_need_npm_install() returns True on
# every launch, and the runtime `npm install` it triggers (a) can never
# converge against the partial monorepo and (b) races itself across concurrent
# embedded-chat (/api/pty) connections → ENOTEMPTY → the chat tab dies with a
# 502 / "[session ended]". Pointing at the prebuilt bundle sidesteps the whole
# check. (A separate launcher hardening is tracked independently.)
